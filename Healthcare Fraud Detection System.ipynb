    "## Deploy Healthcare Fraud Detection System Algorithm from AWS Marketplace \n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare fraud occurs due to collusion of providers, physicians and/ or beneficiaries through misuse of medical insurance systems. Manual detection of frauds in healthcare industry is a strenuous task. This solution involves scrutiny and prediction of potential fraudulent claims based on the analysis of patterns to comprehend the entity's future behavior. Through timely actions, insurance companies can use the likelihood of healthcare fraud to prevent or mitigate losses.\n",
